# Overview of the project and its purpose: 
Inflation, which measures how quickly prices for goods and services rise, ultimately reducing purchasing power, is a crucial economic indicator. Understanding global inflation trends offers valuable insights into economic stability and the overall health of economies worldwide. This project aims to analyze and compare inflation trends across the continent for a 20-year span, identify key drivers, assess the impacts of these trends and explore potential policy responses. By doing so, we hope to provide a comprehensive understanding of inflation's role in the global economy and how it can be managed effectively.
